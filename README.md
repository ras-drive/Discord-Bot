# Personal Discord Bot 

A little rewrite of my old Discord bot this time in Typescript as opposed to Python.
Anyone is free to add to it or test it if they want to. I'm still in the process of
learning the Discord.js library so there are definitely things that I will be changing
as time goes on.

## Steps for running

1. add your token, client id, and guild id to the .env file
2. ```npm setup```
3. ```npm test```
