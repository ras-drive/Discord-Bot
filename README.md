# Personal Discord Bot 

A little rewrite of my old Discord bot this time in JavaScript as opposed to Python.
Anyone is free to add to it or test it if they want to. I'm still in the process of
learning the Discord.js library so there are definitely things that I will be changing
as time goes on.

## Steps for running

run ```$ npm run setup``` and follow the steps to setup the bot.

then you can just open a terminal, make sure you are running Node.js version 16 or above.
Don't forget to run ```$ npm install``` to fetch dependencies, and use ```$ npm run start``` 
to run the bot.
